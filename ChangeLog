	* Version 1.5 released.

	* Playback: Skipping back and forth streams through list hierarchies
	  works.

	  Requires streamplayer 1.4 because of D-Bus interface changes.

	* List views: Refresh lists when they change. In particular, the UPnP
	  server list gets refreshed when servers are discovered or lost,
	  TuneIn lists and UPnP lists get refreshed when network connectivity
	  changes, and the USB device list gets refreshed when plugging
	  devices.

	* DRC protocol: Generate more compact XML data for speed.

	* Misc: Lots of internal changes with regard to playback handling.

	* Version 1.4 released.

	* Browsing: Send alternative stream title to SPI slave. The
	  alternative title is sent in the alttrack tag and is limited to a
	  length of 20 UTF-8 characters.

	  The alternative title is made from the name as it appeared in the
	  list the user selected the stream from. In the very unlikely case
	  that this string was also empty, the plain URL is used instead.

	* Playback: Fix queuing into Streamplayer in linear playback mode.

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* TuneIn view: Default playback mode in single track mode, not linear
	  scan with directory traversals.

	* Playback: Pressing OK or Play on a stream immediately plays that
	  stream. Pressing Stop beforehand is not required anymore.

	  Requires streamplayer 1.3 because of D-Bus interface changes.

	* Playback: Playing a directory is not allowed in single track mode.

	* Playback: Fix playback of most streams from a list.
