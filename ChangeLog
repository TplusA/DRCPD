2016-07-29  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 2.2 released.

	* Playback: The player component has been completely redesigned. It is
	  follows an MVC-like architecture now. This version, however, is a
	  poorly tested one. Any kind of problems may still occur in this
	  version.

	* Stability: Fix rare race-condition in asynchronous list handling
	  code.

2016-07-21  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 2.1 released.

	* User interfaces: Meta data updates are functional again.

	* Stability: Avoid crash on various occasions.

	* Airable: Logout fixed.

	* Misc: Remove many now unneeded log messages to reduce overall CPU
	  consumption.

2016-07-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 2.0 released.

	* Groundwork: Many D-Bus methods are invoked asynchronously now,
	  leading to vast improvement on perceived system response. Due to
	  project time constraints, not all parts have been reworked yet and
	  remain synchronous, but the foundation for moving more code from
	  synchronous to asynchronous messaging has been set.

	  A lot of code had to be touched to get this done, so this version
	  may actually be less stable than previous versions.

	* D-Bus: Method and signal handlers are decoupled from the D-Bus
	  context by an event queue. The intended effects of the D-Bus
	  handlers, especially those parts that can block or are
	  time-consuming, are processed in a different context so that D-Bus
	  communication is never blocked for long or unpredictable times.

	* Misc: Better tracking of busy state.

	* Misc: Avoid some memory leaks.

2016-05-19  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.21 released.

	* Airable: Log out using new D-Bus method for logging out from
	  external services, react on login/logout communicated via new D-Bus
	  signals.

2016-05-04  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.20 released.

	* Airable: Handle logout buttons in Airable.

	* DCP: Increase dcpd timeout to avoid lost messages between dcpd and
	  drcpd in really busy situations.

	* Misc: Adapt to latest changes in Streamplayer D-Bus interfaces.
	  Requires streamplayer 1.8 because of incompatible changes.

2016-04-25  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.19 released.

	* Playback: Continuing a paused stream does not lose the stream
	  information anymore.

2016-04-21  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.18 released.

	* User interface: Searching in lists outside of Airable domain is
	  possible. As long as the lists are sorted, hitting the search button
	  in UPnP or USB view opens a search dialog. The entered string is
	  searched within the currently displayed list, and the selection
	  moves to the entry whose prefix matches best.

	* User interface: Search button within Airable directory jumps
	  directly to the search form of the currently browsed domain.

	* User interface: Moving quickly through long lists by holding the up
	  or down key is actually useful now. It was way too slow in previous
	  versions.

	* User interface: Lists wrap around, jumping to the end of a list is
	  easy and fast now.

	* Stability: Avoid hanging process in various occasions. Some more
	  deadlocks fixed.

2016-04-14  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.17 released.

	* User interface: Broken TIDAL lists are being worked around. The
	  lists do not disappear anymore, but instead the extra empty lines
	  sent by TIDAL are displayed as unplayable "----" lines.

	* User interface: Search box can be reopened as expected after it has
	  been closed due to timeout or stop command.

	* Stability: Avoid hanging process in various occasions. There were
	  several deadlocks in the audio player module.

	* DRCP: Send proper context ID with search forms.

2016-04-08  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.16 released.

	* Playback: Use stream meta data preloaded from external sources where
	  suspected to be available. Currently, this includes the TIDAL and
	  Deezer sections of the Airable directory.

	* Playback: Various other fixes concerning display of stream meta
	  data.

	* TA Control: Catch stream meta data for externally started streams
	  and use them to generate DRC screen updates. Such streams usually
	  originate from the smartphone app.

2016-03-30  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.15 released.

	* User interface: Fix management of busy state indicator.

2016-03-22  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.14 released.

	* User interface: Avoid jumping back to root menu in various
	  situations, especially after having left the device alone for a
	  while.

	* DRCP: Fix screen ID of play view.

	* Stability: Avoid hanging process at shutdown time. Fixes long system
	  shutdown time and system update process.

2016-03-15  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.13 released.

	* Playback: All streams from Airable are played in linear list mode,
	  not single track mode.

	* Playback: Fix long and blocking "Buffering..." messages. This
	  happened for slow sources and may have blocked the display for
	  seconds or even minutes even though a stream was already playing.

	* Playback: Fix start playing of new stream while another stream is
	  playing.

	* Playback: Fix stop playing of streams (meta data are cleared).

2016-03-07  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.12 released.

	* DRC protocol: XML objects sent to the controlling peer are queued
	  when necessary. This means that display updates that previously got
	  lost are sent reliably one after the other now.

2016-03-03  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.11 released.

	* User interface: Support for Airable search forms. This involves
	  requesting and receiving search queries from the user when the user
	  tries to enter a search form.

	  In addition, a mechanism for preloaded queries is implemented as
	  well so that the SPI slave may actively push new queries to us.

	* DRCP: Extended list item types for the viewing pleasure.

2016-02-25  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.10 released.

	* User interface: Avoid screen full of dashes on list failures.

	* User interface: UPnP servers, USB devices, and search forms are not
	  shown as plain directories anymore.

2016-02-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.9 released.

	* Bug fix: Avoid log disruption by very long messages.

2016-02-10  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.8 released.

	* Playback: Make skipping back and forth streams through list
	  hierarchies more intuitive.

	  Requires streamplayer 1.5 because of D-Bus interface changes.

	* Playback: Fix skipping in playing of large directory hierarchies.

	* User interface: Show stream bit rate in more cases.

	* Misc: Fixed a few bugs in user interface.

2016-01-29  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.7 released.

	* Streaming: Improve interoperability with streams started from other
	  programs (such as dcpd when fulfilling smartphone app requests to
	  play certain streams).

	* Streaming: Inform SPI slave about currently playing stream title and
	  URL. Necessary for smartphone app support.

2016-01-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.6 released.

	* User interface: Indicate busy state and show "buffering" message
	  while waiting for Streamplayer to send its start notification.

	* User interface: Update German translation.

	* DRC protocol: Fixed XML output for play view updates.

	* DRC protocol: Send display updates every time a view is activated by
	  slave, even if the view is already active.

2015-12-15  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.5 released.

	* Playback: Skipping back and forth streams through list hierarchies
	  works.

	  Requires streamplayer 1.4 because of D-Bus interface changes.

	* List views: Refresh lists when they change. In particular, the UPnP
	  server list gets refreshed when servers are discovered or lost,
	  TuneIn lists and UPnP lists get refreshed when network connectivity
	  changes, and the USB device list gets refreshed when plugging
	  devices.

	* DRC protocol: Generate more compact XML data for speed.

	* Misc: Lots of internal changes with regard to playback handling.

2015-11-16  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.4 released.

	* Browsing: Send alternative stream title to SPI slave. The
	  alternative title is sent in the alttrack tag and is limited to a
	  length of 20 UTF-8 characters.

	  The alternative title is made from the name as it appeared in the
	  list the user selected the stream from. In the very unlikely case
	  that this string was also empty, the plain URL is used instead.

	* Playback: Fix queuing into Streamplayer in linear playback mode.

2015-11-03  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* TuneIn view: Default playback mode in single track mode, not linear
	  scan with directory traversals.

	* Playback: Pressing OK or Play on a stream immediately plays that
	  stream. Pressing Stop beforehand is not required anymore.

	  Requires streamplayer 1.3 because of D-Bus interface changes.

	* Playback: Playing a directory is not allowed in single track mode.

	* Playback: Fix playback of most streams from a list.

	* Show version information in log, add --version option.

	* Fix crash while browsing UPnP directories.

2015-06-29  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.0 released.

	* First release for testing.
