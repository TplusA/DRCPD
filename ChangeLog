2016-03-22  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.14 released.

	* User interface: Avoid jumping back to root menu in various
	  situations, especially after having left the device alone for a
	  while.

	* DRCP: Fix screen ID of play view.

	* Stability: Avoid hanging process at shutdown time. Fixes long system
	  shutdown time and system update process.

2016-03-15  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.13 released.

	* Playback: All streams from Airable are played in linear list mode,
	  not single track mode.

	* Playback: Fix long and blocking "Buffering..." messages. This
	  happened for slow sources and may have blocked the display for
	  seconds or even minutes even though a stream was already playing.

	* Playback: Fix start playing of new stream while another stream is
	  playing.

	* Playback: Fix stop playing of streams (meta data are cleared).

2016-03-07  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.12 released.

	* DRC protocol: XML objects sent to the controlling peer are queued
	  when necessary. This means that display updates that previously got
	  lost are sent reliably one after the other now.

2016-03-03  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.11 released.

	* User interface: Support for Airable search forms. This involves
	  requesting and receiving search queries from the user when the user
	  tries to enter a search form.

	  In addition, a mechanism for preloaded queries is implemented as
	  well so that the SPI slave may actively push new queries to us.

	* DRCP: Extended list item types for the viewing pleasure.

2016-02-25  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.10 released.

	* User interface: Avoid screen full of dashes on list failures.

	* User interface: UPnP servers, USB devices, and search forms are not
	  shown as plain directories anymore.

2016-02-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.9 released.

	* Bug fix: Avoid log disruption by very long messages.

2016-02-10  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.8 released.

	* Playback: Make skipping back and forth streams through list
	  hierarchies more intuitive.

	  Requires streamplayer 1.5 because of D-Bus interface changes.

	* Playback: Fix skipping in playing of large directory hierarchies.

	* User interface: Show stream bit rate in more cases.

	* Misc: Fixed a few bugs in user interface.

2016-01-29  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.7 released.

	* Streaming: Improve interoperability with streams started from other
	  programs (such as dcpd when fulfilling smartphone app requests to
	  play certain streams).

	* Streaming: Inform SPI slave about currently playing stream title and
	  URL. Necessary for smartphone app support.

2016-01-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.6 released.

	* User interface: Indicate busy state and show "buffering" message
	  while waiting for Streamplayer to send its start notification.

	* User interface: Update German translation.

	* DRC protocol: Fixed XML output for play view updates.

	* DRC protocol: Send display updates every time a view is activated by
	  slave, even if the view is already active.

2015-12-15  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.5 released.

	* Playback: Skipping back and forth streams through list hierarchies
	  works.

	  Requires streamplayer 1.4 because of D-Bus interface changes.

	* List views: Refresh lists when they change. In particular, the UPnP
	  server list gets refreshed when servers are discovered or lost,
	  TuneIn lists and UPnP lists get refreshed when network connectivity
	  changes, and the USB device list gets refreshed when plugging
	  devices.

	* DRC protocol: Generate more compact XML data for speed.

	* Misc: Lots of internal changes with regard to playback handling.

2015-11-16  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.4 released.

	* Browsing: Send alternative stream title to SPI slave. The
	  alternative title is sent in the alttrack tag and is limited to a
	  length of 20 UTF-8 characters.

	  The alternative title is made from the name as it appeared in the
	  list the user selected the stream from. In the very unlikely case
	  that this string was also empty, the plain URL is used instead.

	* Playback: Fix queuing into Streamplayer in linear playback mode.

2015-11-03  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* TuneIn view: Default playback mode in single track mode, not linear
	  scan with directory traversals.

	* Playback: Pressing OK or Play on a stream immediately plays that
	  stream. Pressing Stop beforehand is not required anymore.

	  Requires streamplayer 1.3 because of D-Bus interface changes.

	* Playback: Playing a directory is not allowed in single track mode.

	* Playback: Fix playback of most streams from a list.

	* Version 1.2 released.

	* Requires listbrokers 1.2 because of D-Bus interface changes.

	* Improve error handling: Network failures are handled in a much
	  better way, without freezes or dead displays.

	* Show version information in log, add --version option.
